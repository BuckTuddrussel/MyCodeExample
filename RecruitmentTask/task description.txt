The task is to create a panel displaying data provided by the ServerMock class.

At the same time, the panel can contain up to 5 elements. Upon scene start, the first 5 elements should be displayed.
The "NEXT" and "PREVIOUS" buttons allow navigation and showing the next set of elements (in increments of 5 elements).

The elements have three categories (RED, GREEN, BLUE). Some of them may be marked as special, in which case they should be highlighted.
The data remains unchanged during program execution.
